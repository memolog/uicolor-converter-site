# MEAN-EDGE
This is my personal sandbox to use cutting-edge features around MEAN (actually possibly included non-MEAN stack)

### Install MEAN-EDGE
```
git clone https://github.com/memolog/uicolor-converter-site.git
cd uicolor-converter-site
npm install
npm run build
```

### Start local dev server
```
npm run dev
```

You can see the site at http://localhost:8000/
